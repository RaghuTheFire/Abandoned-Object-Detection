This code implements a real-time object detection system using a pre-trained MobileNet-SSD model. It processes video input from a camera, detects various objects, and implements a specific monitoring system focused on bottles and people.
Key Components

1. Setup and Initialization

const vector<string> CLASSES = {"background", "aeroplane", "bicycle", ...};
vector<Scalar> COLORS;
// Generates random colors for each class
for (int i = 0; i < CLASSES.size(); i++) {
    COLORS.push_back(Scalar(rand() % 256, rand() % 256, rand() % 256));
}
